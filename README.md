# Tokenizer

 * Goals:

 1. Create tokenizer for basic math equations and evalutate them using infix expressions
    -> Implimentation using stacks and AST's  
 
 2. Create a working compiler using what I have learned tokenizing math equations

 3. Create a basic compiler that compiles specifcally for the MSP 430 class of microprocessors
